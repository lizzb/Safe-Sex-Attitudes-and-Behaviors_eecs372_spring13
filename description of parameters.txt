Use helper procedure RANDOM-NEAR from AIDS model, which approximates a "normal" distribution around a given average value by generating many small random numbers and adding them together.

Assign values to variables of agents in the population using the helper procedure RANDOM-NEAR so that individual agents variables follow an approximately "normal" distribution around average values.

The variables of commitment, coupling-tendency, friendship-tendency, certainty (initially), are randomly assigned to each turtle following an approximately normal distribution (the values will vary for each turtle). …. mention attitude too….

Agents might couple depending on their gender, their tendency to couple,
and if they are already friends/in same clique/nearby a potential single mate.

Agents might become friends depending on their tendency to make friends,
and if they are in same clique/nearby a potential friend.

Try to find a valid potential sexual partner (must be opposite sex and not coupled):
Try to find a valid potential friend (must not have reached friend limit, gender irrelevant):


In order to couple, the pairings must consist of one male and one female,
and both partners must be single/uncoupled.

If the agent is not coupled/in a relationship, look for a valid potential sexual partner.
A valid potential sexual partner must be the opposite gender and not coupled.
1) Look at existing friend links of opposite sex
2) Look at opposite sex agents within friend group that are not currently linked to you
3) Find a nearby opposite sex person as a last resort
Based on probability… will try to couple...(probability of successful coupling decreases for last 2 options)


If the agent has not reached their friend limit, look for a valid potential friend.
A valid potential friend must not have reached his/her friend limit (but gender irrelevant).
1) Look at agents within friend group that are not currently linked to you
2) Find a nearby person as a last resort
